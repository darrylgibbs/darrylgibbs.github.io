      <description>This is a tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ve written mostly for my own purposes that I have adapted from the orginal post from [Vultr](How to Install Chamilo 1.11.8 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS - Vultr.com). Kudos to those guys.
Prerequisites   Fresh Ubuntu Server install on a VPS with sudo access.
  A domain pointed at the server.
  Install necessary (and extra) software First, update the system.
sudo apt upgrade -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt dist-upgrade -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt autoremove -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt clean -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo reboot Then, install software we will use for the server.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed watching cars, or any reasonable vehicle, go around in circles.
Motorsport is a career I wish I could have entered, but never had the opportunity, finances or even remotely an ounce of the required skill and bravery.
So, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to settle for watching it on TV and playing video games. Lately, those games have evolved into simulator racing titles, which are both enjoyable and further evidence of my uselessness.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Darryl.
I&amp;rsquo;m a tech enthusiast who is trying to rearrage a sporadic array of IT knowledge into something more logical that will hopefully one day turn into a career.
I dabble in web development (this Hugo based blog is one such project), server hosting, homelabbing, gaming, etc.
I plan to use this blog to write up some tutorials for the benefit of others or my own failing memory, and to pass on other great tutorials that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt from.</description>
