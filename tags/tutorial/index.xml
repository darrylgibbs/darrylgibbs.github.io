      <description>Maybe you are like me and have a small business that requires an invoicing solution. You could pay the $10-15 to have a provider host the service for you (such as FreshBooks) or you could do it yourself with great Open Source software! Thankfully Invoice Ninja has a great app that they can host for you (for a fee) or, if you&amp;rsquo;re adventurous (or cheap&amp;hellip; depending on your perspective) you could host it for yourself!</description>

      <description>This is a tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ve written mostly for my own purposes that I have adapted from the orginal post from TechnicallyComputers. Kudos to him!
Prerequisites   Fresh Ubuntu Server install on a VPS / VM with sudo access.
  Optional: A domain pointed at the server.
  Install necessary (and extra) software First, update the system.
sudo apt upgrade -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt dist-upgrade -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt clean &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt autoremove -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo rebootThen, install software we will use for the server.</description>
