      <description>Maybe you are like me and have a small business that requires an invoicing solution. You could pay the $10-15 to have a provider host the service for you (such as FreshBooks) or you could do it yourself with great Open Source software! Thankfully Invoice Ninja has a great app that they can host for you (for a fee) or, if you&amp;rsquo;re adventurous (or cheap&amp;hellip; depending on your perspective) you could host it for yourself!</description>
