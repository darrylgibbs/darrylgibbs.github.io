      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed watching cars, or any reasonable vehicle, go around in circles.
Motorsport is career I wish I could have entered, but never had the opportunity, finances or even remotely an ounce of the required skill and bravery.
So, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to settle for watching it on TV and playing video games. Lately, those games have evolved into simulator racing titles, which are both enjoyable and further evidence of my uselessness.</description>
