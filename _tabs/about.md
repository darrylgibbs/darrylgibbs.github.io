Hi, I’m Darryl.

I’m a tech enthusiast who is trying to rearrage a sporadic array of IT knowledge into something more logical that will hopefully one day turn into a career.

I dabble in web development (this Hugo based blog is one such project), server hosting, homelabbing, gaming, etc.

I plan to use this blog to write up some tutorials for the benefit of others or my own failing memory, and to pass on other great tutorials that I’ve learnt from.

I could also talk about Formula 1 and my general thoughts on a variety of topics. I will do this all with the complexity and subject knowledge of your average donut.

Welcome!
